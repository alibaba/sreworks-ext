# Introduction

SREWorks Development Resource Library serves as a comprehensive repository encompassing the development resources for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). It includes the source code for various applications available in the application market. It aims to provide a robust ecosystem for SRE practices with modules focusing on AI-driven operations, plug-and-play plugins, best practices demos, and more.

# Directory Structure
- `applications`: Contains various application packages specifically designed for SREWorks.
- `aiops`: Library of modules focusing on AI-driven operations for intelligent system management.
- `demos`: Provides sample demonstrations that follow best practices in SREWorks.
- `plugins`: Repository of plugins to extend the capabilities of SREWorks.
- `aibond`: A framework for operational applications under LLM large models using prompt libraries.

# AIOPS
The `aiops` directory contains specialized libraries designed to assist with AI-driven operations for intelligent system management. These libraries offer an array of functionalities ranging from anomaly detection to log clustering. Below are the descriptions of the key libraries within this directory:

- [AnomalyDetectionBenchmark](./aiops/AnomalyDetectionBenchmark) : Benchmarking Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large-Scale Real-World Datasets
